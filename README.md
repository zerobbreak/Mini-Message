# Mini Messageboard

This is a basic Express.js project for a mini messageboard with two routes: index ("/") and a new-message form ("/new"). The project is set up using Express Generator with Pug as the templating language.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Initialize Git Repository:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Create .gitignore File:**

   Create a `.gitignore` file in the project directory and include the following content:

   ```
   node_modules/
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

- **routes/index.js:** Contains routes for both the index ("/") and new-message form ("/new"). The `router.get()` method for "/" renders the index view with sample messages, and `router.post()` for "/new" handles form submission.

- **views/index.pug:** Displays messages from the `messages` array in a loop.

- **views/form.pug:** Form template with inputs for author's name and message text. Submits a POST request to "/new".

## Handling Form Submission

- The router.post() method in routes/index.js processes form data using the `express-validator` library.

- Access form data in `req.body` (e.g., `req.body.author`, `req.body.message`).

- Validate form inputs and handle errors using `express-validator`.

- Push new messages into the `messages` array.

- Redirect users to the index page after submitting a new message.
